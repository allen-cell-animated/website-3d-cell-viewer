  // - A bare string is a single volume scene with a single source.
  // - An array of only strings is interpreted as a single volume with multiple sources, not a multi-scene collection.
  // - An array of strings *or* string arrays is a multi-scene collection, and all strings within the top-level array
  //   are treated as if they were string arrays with one element (i.e. volumes with one source).
